# Aap-SC Swim Coach

Native iOS app for tracking Apple Fitness swim workouts, progress, medals, benchmarks, and the swim coin economy.

The repository contains **only the iOS app**. Open `ios/AapSC.xcodeproj` in Xcode on macOS to build and run.

## Requirements

- macOS with Xcode 15.4+
- iOS 17.0+ (iPhone or iPad)
- Apple Developer account for physical devices

## Quick start

```bash
open ios/AapSC.xcodeproj
```

Select the **AapSC** scheme, choose a simulator, and press **⌘R**.

See [ios/README.md](ios/README.md) for signing, architecture, and feature details.

## Features

- Progress charts with optional interaction toggle and 3-session moving averages
- Upload swim sessions from Apple Fitness screenshots (Vision OCR) or HealthKit
- History, benchmarks, medals, and monthly challenges
- Swim coin store with themes, icons, vibes, and boosts
- Mini games: Wheel of Fortune, Coin Flip, Pace Pick, Lane Timer
- Mascot coaches, i18n (en/nl/ru/tr), themes including Olympic Pool, dark mode

## Asset scripts

Optional Node scripts under `scripts/` generate app/page icon assets for the iOS catalog:

```bash
node scripts/generate-page-icons.mjs
node scripts/generate-app-icons.mjs
```

## Tests

Run unit tests in Xcode (**⌘U**) or:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project ios/AapSC.xcodeproj -scheme AapSC -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'
```

## TestFlight (automatic builds)

Pushes to **`main`** run [`.github/workflows/testflight.yml`](.github/workflows/testflight.yml): unit tests on macOS, then a Fastlane upload to TestFlight. Each run gets a unique build number (`github.run_number`).

**One-time setup:** configure App Store Connect API secrets in GitHub. See [docs/TESTFLIGHT.md](docs/TESTFLIGHT.md).
